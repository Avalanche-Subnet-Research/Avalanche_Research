# Potential Security Concerns and Threat Scenarios Introduced by ACP-77

## Overview

ACP-77 introduces significant changes to the Avalanche subnet ecosystem, including the separation of Subnet Validators from Primary Network Validators, a continuous fee mechanism, and enhanced sovereignty for Subnets. These changes aim to reduce barriers to entry and increase flexibility, but they also introduce potential security concerns. Identifying and addressing these concerns is critical to ensuring the robustness and reliability of the network.

### New Registration Flow
**Retrieve a BLS Multisig from the Subnet**: Subnets will define their own procedure for prospective validators to retrieve the necessary validator information.
**Issue a RegisterSubnetValidatorTx on the P-Chain**: This transaction will add the Subnet Validator to the Subnet's validator set on the P-Chain.
**SetSubnetValidatorWeightTx**: This transaction will modify the voting weight of a Subnet Validator and manage validator set updates.
**ExitValidatorSetTx**: Subnet Validators can exit the validator set without interacting with the Subnet, ensuring censorship resistance and validator autonomy.
**SetSubnetValidatorManagerTx:** Subnets will set the validator manager location, enabling the use of the new registration flow.
**IncreaseBalanceTx**: This transaction will allow anyone to add additional $AVAX to a Subnet Validator's balance.

### Potential Security Concerns

1. **Increased Number of Validators**
   - **Concern**: Lowering the cost and hardware requirements for becoming a Subnet Validator may lead to a significant increase in the number of validators. This can strain network resources, particularly the P-Chain.
   - **Threat Scenario**: Excessive memory and processing load on the P-Chain could lead to performance degradation or even denial-of-service (DoS) attacks if the system is overwhelmed by the number of validators.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust monitoring and scaling solutions to dynamically manage and allocate resources based on network load.

2. **Malicious Subnet Operators**
   - **Concern**: Subnets now have more control over their validator sets, which could be exploited by malicious operators.
   - **Threat Scenario**: A malicious Subnet operator could remove validators arbitrarily or manipulate validator weights to centralize control, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the Subnet.
   - **Mitigation**: Enforce transparent governance mechanisms within Subnets, and provide validators with tools to verify and audit Subnet operations before participating.

3. **Validator Exit Exploits**
   - **Concern**: Validators can exit the validator set and retrieve their remaining balance at any time, which could be exploited in specific scenarios.
   - **Threat Scenario**: Validators might collude to exit simultaneously, causing disruption in the Subnetâ€™s operation or attempting to withdraw funds during a critical operation.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement penalties or cooldown periods for exits to discourage sudden or coordinated exits, and monitor for unusual exit patterns.

4. **Inadequate Bootstrapping Security**
   - **Concern**: The bootstrapping process for new validators relies on discovering and connecting to existing validators, which could be targeted by attackers.
   - **Threat Scenario**: An attacker could provide false bootstrap nodes, leading new validators to connect to malicious nodes that could manipulate or disrupt their initial state synchronization.
   - **Mitigation**: Use cryptographic proofs and trusted bootstrap nodes to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the bootstrapping process.

5. **Continuous Fee Mechanism Exploits**
   - **Concern**: The continuous fee mechanism introduces a new dynamic where validators must maintain a balance to stay active.
   - **Threat Scenario**: An attacker could manipulate fee dynamics or spam the network with microtransactions to force validators into inactivity or financial strain.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement rate limits and validation checks to prevent abuse of the fee mechanism, and establish clear guidelines for fee adjustments based on network conditions.

6. **Decentralization Trade-offs**
   - **Concern**: While the new system allows more validators, it might also lead to centralization if only a few validators end up dominating due to their resources.
   - **Threat Scenario**: A few powerful validators could dominate the network, reducing overall decentralization and increasing the risk of collusion or centralized control.
   - **Mitigation**: Promote decentralized participation by encouraging diverse validator sets and providing incentives for smaller validators.

### Stress Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Load Testing**
   - **Scenario**: Simulate a high number of validators joining and exiting the network simultaneously.
   - **Objective**: Assess the impact on the P-Chain's performance and stability under extreme load conditions.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Identify potential bottlenecks and implement optimizations to handle peak loads.

2. **Malicious Validator Simulation**
   - **Scenario**: Introduce validators with malicious intent to attempt arbitrary removals, weight manipulations, and coordinated exits.
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the effectiveness of governance and security mechanisms in detecting and mitigating malicious activities.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Enhance monitoring and response strategies to ensure network resilience against malicious actions.

3. **Fee Manipulation Testing**
   - **Scenario**: Test the continuous fee mechanism under various conditions, including fluctuating network activity and targeted fee manipulation attempts.
   - **Objective**: Ensure the fee mechanism remains fair and robust under different usage patterns and potential attacks.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Refine the fee calculation and enforcement process to prevent abuse and ensure sustainability.

4. **Bootstrapping Reliability**
   - **Scenario**: Conduct tests with different bootstrapping methods, including scenarios with compromised bootstrap nodes.
   - **Objective**: Verify the security and reliability of the bootstrapping process for new validators.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Implement stronger authentication and validation methods for bootstrap nodes.

5. **Governance Model Evaluation**
   - **Scenario**: Simulate various governance models within Subnets to test decision-making processes and dispute resolution.
   - **Objective**: Ensure that governance mechanisms are transparent, efficient, and resistant to manipulation.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Develop best practices for Subnet governance to maintain security and fairness.
